/// private timeout or a `Stream.first` that only errors once the player
/// closes its controllers.

/// Arm before [Player.open] so a synchronously fast backend cannot outrun the
/// subscriptions. Only signals for the file this attempt loads count: mpv's
/// `start-file` after arming delimits them, and on Android ExoPlayer only a
/// first frame after its media-item transition is conclusive — an `end-file`
/// before [backendSwitched] is not, because the fallback core may still load
/// the file. Such a terminal ExoPlayer failure reaches this object through
/// the screen's error handler and [abort].
///
/// Every future resolves `true` on its event and `false` — never throws —
/// once the load failed, [abort] ran, or the player's streams closed. The
/// optional deadline counts from the backend's load start and aborts a
