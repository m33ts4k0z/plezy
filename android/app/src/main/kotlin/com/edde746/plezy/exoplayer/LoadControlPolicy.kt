/**
 * Auto sizing for [androidx.media3.exoplayer.DefaultLoadControl]'s `targetBufferBytes` (#1618).
 *
 * A byte cap collapses as bitrate rises: 64 MiB is 53s of a 10 Mbit/s stream but 5.2s of a
 * 103 Mbit/s UHD remux. With `prioritizeTimeOverSizeThresholds = false` the cap is hard, so
 * read-ahead that short starves the audio sink in bursts — enough, on some routes, to keep a
 * passthrough AudioTrack from ever starting.
 *
 * The tiers this replaced came from mpv demuxer OOM tuning and handed ExoPlayer a flat
 * 64 MiB, under half of what media3 would pick for the same selection
 * ([MEDIA3_DEFAULT_TARGET_BYTES]). The fix is not "buffer more than upstream", it is "stop
 * buffering less unless the heap requires it".
 *
 * Not bitrate-aware: the `LoadControl` is built during `initialize`, before any media is
 * opened, so a byte budget is all that is knowable.
