 * whatever it is allowed, which crowds a 1 GB TV box until Android's
 * low-memory killer takes the whole app. Tiered off
 * [android.app.ActivityManager.getLargeMemoryClass], the same signal
 * `stream_buffer_sizing.dart` and ExoPlayer's `LoadControlPolicy` use.
 *
 * Applied as pre-init *options* in [MpvPlayerCore], so a `demuxer-max-bytes`
 * line in the user's mpv.conf still wins; [forTrimLevel] re-derives it from
 * the same table when Android reports memory pressure, and the core writes
 * that as a property mid-session. Android never says when pressure ends, so
 * the core polls the LMK threshold and walks the budget back one rung at a
 * time ([widenedToward], gated by [canWiden]).
