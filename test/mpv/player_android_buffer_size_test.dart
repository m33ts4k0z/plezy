/// Drives the Buffer Size contract between Dart and `ExoPlayerPlugin` (#1618).
///
/// Auto still sends `demuxer-max-bytes`, because mpv's demuxer shares the property and the
/// plugin's mpv fallback replays it. Only `bufferSizeAuto` tells the native side that the
/// value was derived for the demuxer and that `LoadControlPolicy` should size ExoPlayer's
/// allocator instead. Getting that flag wrong is silent: playback still works, just with the
/// 64MB cap that starves a high-bitrate passthrough track.
